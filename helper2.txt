 - lets wait for the dependencies to install -- this dependencies will be used all the time throught the project
 --- react-dom -> for the dom management
 --- react-router-dom -> for routing purposes
 --- react-flip-move -> for entry animations and scrolling animations
 --- firebase -> database services and deployement
 --- react-ionicons -> a range of various icons which we will need
 --- bootstrap -> css framework to help us in fast development purposes
 --- uiw -> advanced material ui components
 --- material ui -> for ready made components

&& I MISSED THIS LAST TWO SO LETS ADD THEM
uiw and material ui core

 --- lets wait for the two to install---
 >>> Open vscode as it is better for react development purposes and open the project there
>> that is our project with alot of files
We shall delete some and make our project look nicer in structure

>> our dependencies are installed
LETS POWER UP OUR SERVER
	% npm start

>> We wait for it to fire up and
